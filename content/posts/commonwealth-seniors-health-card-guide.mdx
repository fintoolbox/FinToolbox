## What is the CSHC?

The Commonwealth Seniors Health Card is a concession card for older Australians who have reached Age Pension age but don't receive the Age Pension or a payment from the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

It's designed to make healthcare and medicines more affordable for self-funded retirees whose income is below a certain threshold.

## Key Benefits of the CSHC

Holding a CSHC gives you access to several valuable concessions:

- **Cheaper Medicines:** Get prescription medicines at the discounted Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) rate.
- **Bulk Billed Doctor Visits:** More likely to be bulk-billed by doctors (at their discretion).
- **Bigger Refunds:** Receive a higher refund for medical costs when you reach the Medicare Safety Net.

Depending on your state or territory, you may also get discounts on electricity, gas, water, property rates, and public transport.

## Who is Eligible? (The Income Test)

To get the CSHC, you must meet four main criteria:

1.  Be of Age Pension age (currently 67).
2.  Meet residency requirements.
3.  Not be receiving any payment from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
4.  Meet the income test.

The income test is the most important hurdle. Unlike the Age Pension, there is **no assets test**. Your eligibility depends solely on your "assessable income".

### How is Income Assessed?

Centrelink uses a specific formula to assess your income. It's a combination of your **Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI)** and a **deemed amount** from any account-based pensions you hold.

- **Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI):** This is your taxable income plus add-backs like reportable super contributions (salary sacrifice), total net investment losses, and certain foreign income.
- **Deeming:** This is a set of rules used to estimate the income you earn from your financial assets. For the CSHC, deeming only applies to account-based pensions. Centrelink assumes these pensions earn a certain rate of income, regardless of what they actually earn.

The income limits are updated annually. For the 2025-26 financial year, the thresholds are:

- **Singles:** $101,105
- **Couples (combined):** $161,768
- **Couples separated by illness:** $202,210

An extra $639.60 is allowed for each dependent child.

## Common Questions

**1. Does my family home count in any test?**
No. The CSHC has no assets test, so the value of your home is not included.

**2. What if my income changes?**
You must notify Centrelink if your income changes and you no longer meet the test. The income test is applied annually.

**3. Do deeming rates change?**
Yes, the government can change deeming rates at any time, which can affect your eligibility. Our calculator is kept up-to-date with the latest rates.

## The Bottom Line

The CSHC is a valuable card for self-funded retirees. If you're not eligible for the Age Pension, it's the next best thing for reducing your healthcare costs.

Given there's no assets test, it's well worth checking if your income falls within the threshold.
