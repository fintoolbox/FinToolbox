Planning your retirement income shouldn’t feel like a spreadsheet marathon.  
Our **Account-Based Pension (ABP) Calculator** makes it simple to set an annual income, apply **CPI indexing**, and automatically respect the **legislated minimum drawdown** for your age.

Whether you’re just starting your pension or reviewing an existing one, the calculator shows how your **income, balance, returns, and fees** interact over time.

## What you’ll need

Before you begin, have these details handy:

- **Opening ABP balance** (e.g. $500,000)  
- Your **current age**  
- Expected **investment return** (per year)  
- Estimated **fees** (per year)  
- Your **preferred annual pension amount**  
- Optional: expected **inflation (CPI)** rate if you want to index payments each year  

These inputs allow the calculator to model realistic income and balance projections under Australian rules.

## How to use the calculator

1. Open the **[Account-Based Pension Calculator](/calculators/account-based-pension)**.  
2. Enter your starting balance, age, return assumptions, and fees.  
3. Choose your desired **annual pension**.  
   - If it’s below the minimum, the calculator will automatically apply the **legislated minimum** for your age.  
4. Turn on **“Index by inflation (CPI)”** if you want your pension to increase with living costs.  
5. Select your **projection length** and review the results in the charts.

> **Tip:** The calculator displays both **annual income** and **balance projections** side by side, so you can see how withdrawals, earnings, and fees affect your pension over time.

## Understanding the outputs

The results help you visualise how your income and balance evolve throughout retirement:

- **Income projection** – shows your pension payments year by year, with CPI adjustments (and minimums enforced).  
- **Balance projection** – tracks how your super balance changes after withdrawals, earnings, and fees.  
- **Totals** – shows total income drawn and your final balance at the end of the projection.  
- **Minimum drawdown table** – displays the current legislated percentage by age group.

> **Example:** A 70-year-old with a $500,000 balance must draw at least 5% ($25,000) in the first year. The minimum increases with age.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

Avoid these common mistakes when modelling your pension:

- **Ignoring minimum drawdowns:** The government sets mandatory minimums based on age — the calculator applies them automatically.  
- **Underestimating fees:** Even a 1% annual fee compounds over time, reducing your long-term balance.  
- **Overly optimistic returns:** Run at least one scenario with a lower investment return to stress-test your plan.  
- **Forgetting inflation:** Without CPI indexing, your real spending power can fall each year.

---

## Next steps

Once you’ve tested a few scenarios:

- Compare **different CPI rates** (e.g. 2% vs 3%)  
- Model **higher drawdowns** for the first few years of retirement  
- See how **lower returns** affect your future balance  
- Review the results with your **financial adviser or fund representative**

> The goal isn’t just to maximise income — it’s to create a sustainable, flexible plan that lasts as long as you do.
