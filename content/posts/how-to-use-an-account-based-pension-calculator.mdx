Planning your retirement income shouldn’t require a spreadsheet marathon. Our **Account-Based Pension (ABP) Calculator** helps you set a realistic annual pension, apply **CPI indexing**, and automatically respects the **legislated minimum drawdown** for your age.

## What you’ll need

- Opening ABP balance (e.g. \$500,000)  
- Your current **age**  
- Expected **investment return** (p.a.)  
- Estimated **fees** (p.a.)  
- Your preferred **annual pension amount**  
- Optional: **Inflation (CPI)** to index your pension each year

## How to use it

1. Open the **[ABP Calculator](/calculators/account-based-pension)**.  
2. Enter your balance, age, return and fee assumptions.  
3. Choose your **annual pension**. If it’s below the legal minimum, the tool will pay the **minimum** instead.  
4. Toggle **Index by inflation (CPI)** and set a rate if you want payments to keep pace with prices.  
5. Choose your projection length and review the charts.

> Tip: The calculator shows **income by year** and a separate **balance projection** so you can see drawdowns, earnings and fees in context.

## Understanding the outputs

- **Income projection**: your paid pension each year, with CPI indexing if enabled (and minimums enforced).  
- **Balance projection**: estimated end-of-year balance after income, earnings and fees.  
- **Totals**: cumulative income withdrawn and final balance.  
- **Minimum rates**: a quick table of legislated drawdown percentages by age.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Picking an income that ignores **minimum drawdown** rules.  
- Assuming fees are negligible—small percentages matter over decades.  
- Using an optimistic return without testing a lower-return scenario.

## Next steps

Run a few versions: **+1% CPI**, **–1% returns**, or a higher pension for the first five years.  
Then discuss the results with your adviser or fund.
