**Compound interest** is often called *the eighth wonder of the world* — and for good reason.  
It’s interest on interest: your balance earns returns, and those returns go on to earn their own returns. Over time, the growth curve bends sharply upwards — a snowball effect for your savings and investments.

## What Is Compound Interest?

With **simple interest**, you only earn returns on your original deposit.  
With **compound interest**, you earn returns on both your original amount *and* the accumulated interest from previous periods.

That’s why compound interest is so powerful — it turns time into your greatest ally.  
The longer your money stays invested, the faster it grows, even if your contribution rate doesn’t change.

## The Compound Interest Formula

`FV = P × (1 + r/n)^(n × t)`

Where:

- **FV** = future value (the amount you’ll have at the end)  
- **P** = principal or starting amount  
- **r** = annual interest rate (as a decimal, e.g. 6% → 0.06)  
- **n** = number of compounding periods per year (e.g. 12 for monthly)  
- **t** = time in years

This formula captures the exponential nature of growth — each period builds on the last.

## Worked Example

Let’s say you start with **$5,000**, add **$100 each month**, and earn **6% per year**, compounded monthly, for **10 years**.

- Total contributions: **$17,000**  
- Final balance: **≈ $23,500**  
- Growth from compounding: **≈ $6,500**

That extra $6,500 didn’t come from your wallet — it came from time and consistency.

> **Tip:** Adding regular monthly investments makes a big difference when building an investment portfolio.

## Visualising Compound Growth

Imagine pushing a snowball down a hill. At first, it’s small and slow, but as it rolls, it gathers more snow and momentum. That’s compounding in action — growth that accelerates over time.

The early years may feel uneventful, but later growth dominates. The last few years of an investment often add more value than all the previous years combined.

## Try It With Your Numbers

Use our free **[Compound Interest Calculator](/calculators/investment-growth)** to see how your savings could grow.  
Tweak your rate, timeframe, and deposits to understand how each factor affects your future balance.

> Tip: Choose a **“real (after-inflation)”** return for a more conservative, realistic projection of your purchasing power.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Ignoring fees:** management fees, fund costs, or trading charges can significantly slow growth.  
  *Aim to keep total fees below 1% where possible.*
- **Stopping contributions:** missing months breaks the compounding rhythm. Automate deposits to stay consistent.  
- **Chasing high returns:** steady, realistic growth compounds more reliably than volatile, risky bets.

---

## How To Maximise Compounding

- **Invest early:** every extra year matters.  
- **Reinvest returns:** don’t withdraw dividends or interest — let them compound.  
- **Increase deposits gradually:** even small annual increases make a huge impact.  
- **Stay invested:** market dips are temporary, but pulling out stops the compounding clock.

---

## The Bottom Line

Compound interest rewards patience, discipline, and time.  

You don’t need to be a financial expert — you just need to start, contribute regularly, and let the maths do its work.

Start small, stay consistent, and watch your wealth snowball.

## FAQs About Compound Interest (Australia)

### What is compound interest in simple terms?
Compound interest means you earn interest on both your original money and the interest that builds up over time. Each period, the total grows a little faster because your returns also start earning returns.

### How often is interest compounded in Australia?
It depends on the account or investment.  
Most Australian savings accounts compound **monthly**, while some investment products compound **quarterly** or **annually**. Always check your provider’s product disclosure statement for details.

### Is compound interest taxable in Australia?
Yes — any interest you earn on bank accounts or investments is typically included in your **assessable income** for the financial year.  
You’ll pay income tax on it at your marginal rate, unless the investment is held inside a tax-advantaged structure such as **superannuation**.

### What’s better: monthly or annual compounding?
More frequent compounding (monthly or quarterly) results in slightly faster growth, because interest is added to your balance more often. Over decades, that small difference can add up.

### How do I calculate compound interest easily?
Use our free **[Compound Interest Calculator](/calculators/investment-growth)** — it automatically applies the compound interest formula and shows your projected balance over time.

### Can compound interest work against you?
Yes — if you have **debt** such as a credit card or personal loan, compound interest can make the balance grow quickly if you don’t make repayments. That’s why it’s important to clear high-interest debts before focusing on long-term investing.
