**Compound interest** is interest on interest. Your balance earns returns, then those returns also earn returns—like a snowball rolling downhill.

## The formula (lightweight)

`FV = P × (1 + r/n)^(n × t)`

Where:
- **P** = starting amount  
- **r** = annual rate (decimal)  
- **n** = compounding periods per year  
- **t** = years invested

## A quick example

Start with **\$5,000**, add **\$100/month**, earn **6% p.a.**, compounded monthly for **10 years**.

- Final balance ≈ **\$23,500**  
- Total contributions: \$17,000  
- Growth from compounding ≈ \$6,500

> Small, regular deposits + time = big impact.

## Try it with your numbers

Use our **[Compound Interest Calculator](/calculators/investment-growth)** to tweak rate, deposits, and timeframe. Switch to **real (after-inflation)** if you want a cautious view.

## Pro tips

- Consistency beats timing  
- Fees slow compounding—aim to keep them low  
- Automate weekly/fortnightly deposits to stay on track
