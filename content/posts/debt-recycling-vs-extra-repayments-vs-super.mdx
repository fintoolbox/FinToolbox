You've got a mortgage, but you're also earning a good income and have some surplus cash flow each month. This puts you in a fortunate but tricky position. What's the smartest way to use that extra money to build wealth and secure your financial future?

For most Australians, the decision boils down to three popular strategies:

1.  **The Simple Path:** Making extra repayments on your home loan.
2.  **The Long-Term Play:** Boosting your retirement nest egg with extra super contributions.
3.  **The Advanced Lever:** Using a debt recycling strategy to invest.

Each path has distinct benefits, risks, and tax implications. There's no single "best" answer, but there is a "best fit" for your personal goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

This article compares these three strategies head-to-head to help you understand which one might be right for you.

## Strategy 1: The Simple Path — Making Extra Repayments

This is the most straightforward strategy. Any money you pay into your mortgage above your minimum required repayment goes directly toward reducing the principal.

**How it works:** You simply direct any spare cash into your home loan or a linked offset account. The effect is immediate — you'll pay less interest and shorten the life of your loan.

### Pros:
*   **Guaranteed, risk-free return:** The return on your money is equal to the interest rate on your home loan. If your rate is 6%, you're getting a guaranteed, tax-free 6% return on every extra dollar you contribute.
*   **Simplicity:** It's easy to set up and requires no complex financial products or structures.
*   **Psychological win:** Watching your mortgage balance fall faster provides a great sense of security and progress.

### Cons:
*   **Lower potential returns:** Your return is capped at your home loan interest rate, which is typically lower than the long-term average returns of growth assets like shares.
*   **Doesn't build other assets:** Your net worth increases, but all your wealth is tied up in a single, non-liquid asset (your home).
*   **Liquidity:** While you can often redraw extra repayments, the primary goal is to "trap" the money as home equity.

**Who is it best for?** Those who are risk-averse, prefer simplicity, are nearing retirement, or have high-interest personal debt they should be clearing first.

## Strategy 2: The Long-Term Play — Extra Super Contributions

This strategy involves funnelling your extra cash into your superannuation fund, either through salary sacrificing (pre-tax) or personal contributions (post-tax).

**How it works:** You arrange with your employer to sacrifice some of your pre-tax salary into super, or you make a personal contribution and potentially claim it as a tax deduction. This money is then invested by your super fund.

### Pros:
*   **Significant tax benefits:** Concessional (pre-tax) contributions are generally taxed at just 15% going into your fund, which is much lower than most people's marginal tax rate. [1] High-income earners may pay an additional 15% (Division 293 tax), but it's still a favourable rate. [2]
*   **Low-tax environment:** Investment earnings inside super are taxed at a maximum of 15%, allowing your wealth to compound more effectively.
*   **Forced discipline:** The money is locked away until you reach preservation age, preventing you from dipping into it for other purposes.

### Cons:
*   **Funds are inaccessible:** You cannot access the money until you meet a condition of release, typically retirement. This makes it unsuitable for medium-term goals.
*   **Contribution caps:** The government limits how much you can contribute each year under the concessional and non-concessional caps. [1]
*   **Less control:** While you can choose your fund's investment option (e.g., High Growth, Balanced), you don't have direct control over the specific assets purchased.

**Who is it best for?** High-income earners looking to reduce their taxable income, and anyone focused purely on maximising their retirement savings for the very long term.

## Strategy 3: The Advanced Lever — Debt Recycling

Debt recycling is a more active strategy that aims to achieve two goals at once: pay off your "bad" non-deductible home loan debt faster while building an investment portfolio.

**How it works:** In short, you pay down a portion of your home loan and then redraw those funds through a separate, dedicated loan split. You use this new loan to invest in income-producing assets like shares or ETFs. The interest on the investment loan is now tax-deductible.

All investment income (dividends, distributions) and tax benefits (from negative gearing and franking credits) are then used to make extra repayments on your original home loan, accelerating the process.

### Pros:
*   **Builds an external asset base:** You're not just paying off a loan; you're actively building a portfolio of investments that can grow in value.
*   **Tax-deductible debt:** You systematically convert your "bad" home loan debt into "good" investment debt, where the interest can be claimed as a tax deduction.
*   **Potential for higher returns:** You are exposed to the growth potential of the share market, which has historically outperformed mortgage interest rates over the long term.

### Cons:
*   **Higher risk:** This is a leveraged investment strategy. If the market falls, your portfolio could be worth less than your investment loan.
*   **Complexity:** It requires careful setup (separate loan splits) and diligent administration to avoid contaminating the loan purpose and losing tax deductibility.
*   **Requires discipline:** The strategy's success depends on you consistently reinvesting all proceeds back into the home loan.

**Who is it best for?** Financially disciplined individuals with a long investment horizon (10+ years), a stable income, and a comfortable tolerance for market volatility.

## How to Model Your Options

Comparing these strategies can feel abstract. While a full financial plan is the best way to compare all three, you can model the powerful effect of a debt recycling strategy against simply paying off your home loan.

Our free **[Debt Recycling Calculator](/calculators/debt-recycling)** is designed for this.

It lets you input your own numbers—loan balance, interest rates, and tax rate—to see a side-by-side projection. You can compare the timeline of just making normal repayments against a debt recycling strategy and see the potential year you could become completely debt-free by using your investment portfolio to clear all remaining debt.

## Final Thoughts

There is no magic bullet.

*   **Making extra repayments** is a safe and steady path to financial security.
*   **Boosting your super** is a tax-effective, set-and-forget strategy for a comfortable retirement.
*   **Debt recycling** is an active, higher-risk strategy for those looking to accelerate wealth creation by using leverage.

The right choice depends entirely on your personal appetite for risk, your timeline, and your financial goals. Many people use a combination of these strategies. The most important step is to make a conscious decision and put your surplus cash to work.
