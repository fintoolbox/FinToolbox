The Australian **Age Pension** is a cornerstone of retirement income for millions of Australians.  

But the rules?  
Well… they're not exactly simple.

This guide breaks it down in plain English — how it works, who qualifies, how payments are calculated, and smart, legal strategies to **maximise what you're entitled to**.

> Use our free [Age Pension Calculator](/calculators/age-pension) to work out your entitlements.

All figures in this article are current as at **20 September 2025**.

## What is the Age Pension?

The **Age Pension is a government income support payment** designed to help older Australians cover basic living costs in retirement.

It acts as a safety net — but even Australians with savings and investments can qualify for a **full or part pension**.

---

## Who is eligible?

To receive the Age Pension, you must meet:

- **Age requirement** — currently age **67**
- **Residency requirements**
- **Means testing** (income & assets tests)

Let's break those down.

---

## Age requirement

You are eligible once you turn **67** (no further increases legislated).

---

## Residency requirements

You generally need to:

- Be an Australian resident, and
- Have lived in Australia for **10 years**, with at least **5 consecutive** years

There are exceptions (e.g., certain visas, international social security agreements), but most retirees meet these.

---

## How much can you receive?

### **Maximum Age Pension rates — as at 20 September 2025**

## How Centrelink calculates your pension

Centrelink applies **both** the:

1. **Income Test**, and
2. **Assets Test**

Whichever results in the **lower payment** is the one used.

---

## The Assets Test

Your **home is exempt**, but most other assets count, including:

- Bank accounts
- Accumulation Super (once you reach pension age)
- Account Based Pensions
- Investments & shares
- Investment property
- Cars & boats
- Personal assets and collectibles

### **Assets limits — 20 September 2025**

| Situation | Full Pension Cut-Off | Part Pension Cut-Off |
|---|---:|---:|
| Single homeowner | $301,750 | $686,250 |
| Single non-homeowner | $543,750 | $928,250 |
| Couple homeowners (combined) | $451,500 | $1,031,000 |
| Couple non-homeowners (combined) | $693,500 | $1,273,000 |

> Amounts above lower threshold reduce pension at **$3 per $1,000 of assets**.

---

## The Income Test

Assessable income includes:

- Salary (if still working)
- Rental income
- Deemed income on account based pensions, super, investments & bank accounts

### **Income limits — 20 September 2025**

| Situation | Full Pension Up To | Part Pension Cut-Off |
|---|---:|---:|
| Single | $204/fortnight | $2,444/fortnight |
| Couple (combined) | $360/fortnight | $3,736/fortnight |

> Pension reduces by **50c for every $1** over the threshold.

---

## Understanding Deeming (Investment Income Rules)

Centrelink doesn't look at actual investment returns — it uses **deeming rates**:

| Investment Amount | Deeming Rate |
|---|---:|
| Up to $60,400 (single) / $100,200 (couple) | **0.25%** |
| Above those amounts | **2.25%** |

---

## Example: Single Homeowner

**Assets:**

- Home: exempt  
- Account Based Pension: $300,000  
- Cash: $20,000  
- Car & contents: $15,000  
- **Total assessable assets: $335,000**

Assets test threshold: **$301,750**

Amount over: $335,000 − $301,750 = $33,250  
Reduction: $33,250 ÷ $1,000 × $3 = **$99.75/fortnight**

Full rate: $1,116.30  
New rate: **$1,016.55/fortnight**

## Gifting rules (be careful!)

You can gift:

- Up to **$10,000 per financial year**, capped at
- **$30,000 over five years**

Gifting above limits **still counts as your asset** for Centrelink. This is considered a deprived asset.

---

## Ways to increase your Age Pension

> Note: Seek specialist advice for advice relating to your personal circumstances.

### 1) **Re-structure assets**

Reduce assessable assets by:

- Paying down your mortgage (if you still have a balance)
- Renovating your home (exempt asset)
- Buying essential household items
- Gifting within the allowable rules

### 2) **Use super rules wisely**

For people with a younger spouse who is under age pension age:

- Move assets to younger spouse's accumulation super account (not assessed while under age pension age)
- Use contribution strategies (downsizer, personal, spouse contributions)

### 3) **Review income stream products**

Some **lifetime annuities** receive favourable treatment.

### 4) **Plan withdrawals & investment mix**

- Reduce cash buffers if excessive
- Keep records of spending vs gifting

---

## Age Pension + Super = Strategy

Many Australians use a **blended retirement income strategy**:

- Super pension withdrawals (tax-free after 60)
- Age Pension income
- Investments & cash buffers

The right mix = flexibility + security.

---

## Why planning matters

Small tweaks can mean:

- **Thousands more per year**
- Earlier eligibility
- Higher cash flow
- A smoother retirement

Planning before pension age helps.

---
