## What is the Age Pension?

The **Age Pension** is a government payment that helps older Australians cover living costs in retirement.  
It’s a safety net — but many retirees with modest savings or investments still qualify for a **part or full pension**.

## Income & Assets Tests

Centrelink runs **both tests** and pays whichever gives you the **lower amount**.

### **Assets test (20 Sept 2025)**

Your **home is exempt**, but most other assets are counted — such as super, bank accounts, shares, and investment properties.

| Situation | Full Pension Up To | Cut-Off |
|---|---:|---:|
| Single homeowner | $301,750 | $686,250 |
| Couple homeowners | $451,500 | $1,031,000 |

> Pension reduces by **$3 per $1,000** of assets above the threshold.

### **Income test (20 Sept 2025)**

Assessable income includes wages, rent, and deemed investment income.

| Situation | Full Pension Up To | Cut-Off |
|---|---:|---:|
| Single | $204/fortnight | $2,444/fortnight |
| Couple (combined) | $360/fortnight | $3,736/fortnight |

> Pension reduces by **50c for every $1** over the threshold.

---

## Deeming rules

Centrelink doesn’t use your actual investment returns — it uses **deeming rates** to estimate income.

| Amount | Deeming rate |
|---|---:|
| Up to $60,400 (single) / $100,200 (couple) | **0.25%** |
| Above those amounts | **2.25%** |

This simplifies the process and avoids constant reporting, but may under- or over-estimate income when markets move.

## Example: Single homeowner

**Assets:**

- Account-based pension: $300,000  
- Cash: $20,000  
- Car & contents: $15,000  
- **Total assessable assets: $335,000**

Threshold: $301,750  
Amount over: $33,250  
Reduction: $33,250 ÷ 1,000 × $3 = **$99.75/fortnight**

Full rate $1,116.30 − $99.75 = **$1,016.55/fortnight**

> Result: Part pension based on the assets test.
