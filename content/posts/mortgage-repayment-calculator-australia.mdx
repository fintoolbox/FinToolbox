Owning a home is a big step. A **mortgage repayment calculator** helps you estimate what your loan will cost weekly, fortnightly, or monthly—before you apply.

## What you’ll need

- Loan amount (e.g. \$650,000)
- Interest rate (fixed or variable)
- Loan term (e.g. 30 years)
- Repayment frequency (weekly/fortnightly/monthly)
- Optional: **extra repayments** or an offset balance

## Step-by-step

1. Open our **[Mortgage Calculator](/calculators/mortgage)**.
2. Enter your loan amount, rate, and term.
3. Choose **principal & interest** or **interest-only**.
4. Switch repayment **frequency** to compare totals.
5. Add **extra repayments**—see how the term shortens.

> Tip: Fortnightly repayments can effectively add one extra month of repayments each year without feeling it.

## Understanding the outputs

- **Repayment**: your regular payment amount  
- **Total interest**: what you’ll pay over the full term  
- **Loan end date**: based on chosen frequency  
- **Amortisation table**: year-by-year principal vs interest

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Forgetting annual **fees** or **LMI** in your budget  
- Comparing fixed vs variable without checking **break costs**  
- Assuming an intro rate lasts the whole term

## Next steps

- Get a ballpark with the calculator, then speak to your lender or broker.
- Run scenarios: +0.50% rate rise, extra \$50/week, shorter term.
- Want to save interest? Consider **offset** + **extra repayments**.
