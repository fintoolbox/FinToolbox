Changing repayment **frequency** can shave interest and shorten your loan—without feeling harder.

## The quick take

- **Weekly/Fortnightly** often leads to slightly lower total interest than monthly  
- Adding even **\$20/week** extra can chop years off a long loan

## Test it yourself

Open the **[Loan Repayment Calculator](/calculators/mortgage)** and:

1. Set amount, rate, and term  
2. Toggle **weekly**, **fortnightly**, **monthly**  
3. Add **extra repayments** and watch total interest fall

## Why frequency matters

More frequent payments reduce the **average daily balance**, so less interest accrues between payments.

> If cash flow is tight, keep frequency monthly but set a small, automatic extra payment.
