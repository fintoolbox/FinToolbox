## Why you need a savings goal

Having a clear savings goal turns a vague idea into a plan.  
Whether you’re building an emergency fund, planning a holiday, or saving for a home deposit, knowing your **target and timeline** gives you focus and motivation.

## What to enter

The calculator only needs a few details:

- **Target amount** — the total you want to reach (for example, $8,000)  
- **Current savings** — what you’ve already set aside  
- **Deadline** — in months or years (for example, 12 months)  
- **Expected interest** — optional, if you’re earning interest in a savings account

It then works out **how much to save each week or fortnight** to reach your goal on time.

---

## How it works

Behind the scenes, the calculator uses the **future value of a series** formula.  
In simple terms, it calculates the deposit required (weekly or fortnightly) to grow your balance — including any interest — to the target by your deadline.

---

## Example: hitting an $8,000 goal

| Detail | Amount |
|--------|--------:|
| Target | $8,000 |
| Current savings | $1,200 |
| Interest rate | 3% p.a. (monthly compounding) |
| Timeframe | 12 months |

Required savings: **~$133 per week** (or **~$266 per fortnight**).

> Adjust the interest rate or deadline in the calculator to see how the weekly number moves.

## Tips to stay on track

- **Automate transfers** on payday  
- **Keep savings separate** from everyday spending  
- **Track progress** monthly with the calculator  
- **Increase savings** after pay rises, refunds, or bonuses

## FAQ

**How accurate is the result?**  
It’s a projection based on your interest rate and cadence. Actual results vary with your bank’s compounding rules.

**Can I include irregular deposits?**  
This tool assumes consistent contributions. You can periodically bump “current savings” to reflect lump sums.

**What interest rate should I use?**  
Use your account rate, or a conservative 3–4% p.a. If unsure, try 0% to see the pure deposit required.

**What if I’m paid fortnightly?**  
Choose fortnightly so it lines up with your pay — it keeps automation simple.
