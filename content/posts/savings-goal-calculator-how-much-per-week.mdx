Have a goalâ€”holiday, car deposit, emergency fund? A **savings goal calculator** tells you the **weekly or fortnightly** amount to hit it on time.

## What to enter

- Target amount (e.g. \$8,000)  
- Current savings  
- Deadline (e.g. 12 months)  
- Expected interest (optional)

## How it works

We reverse-engineer the **required deposit** using the future value of a series. If youâ€™re getting some interest, we include that too.

## Example

- Target: \$8,000 in 12 months  
- Current: \$1,200  
- Interest: 3% p.a. (monthly)

**Result:** save roughly **\$133/week**. Switch to fortnightly if that lines up with your pay cycle.

## Stick with it

- Automate transfers the day you get paid  
- Park savings in a separate high-interest account  
- Track progress monthly inside the calculator
