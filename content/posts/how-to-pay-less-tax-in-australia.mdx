## How to pay less tax in Australia (legally)

No one likes overpaying tax. While we all need to contribute our fair share, **the ATO only expects you to pay the tax you're legally required to pay — nothing more**.

This guide walks through **legitimate, ATO-compliant** strategies that everyday Australians use to minimise tax, boost long-term wealth, and keep more of what they earn. It blends the pragmatic tone of the AFR with the everyday practicality of the Barefoot Investor.

## Salary sacrifice to super

Salary sacrifice means directing part of your pre-tax income into super. It reduces your **taxable income**, and the contribution is taxed at **15% inside super** (instead of your marginal rate, which may be 32%, 37% or 47% incl. Medicare).

> **Key limit:** The concessional cap is **$30,000 per year** (from 1 July 2024), including employer SG and any salary-sacrificed amounts.

**Why it works**

- Reduces taxable income now  
- Your super gets more money invested for retirement  
- Tax rate on contributions is typically lower than your marginal rate  

**But… take-home pay drops**

Salary sacrifice improves your **overall after-tax wealth**, but does **not** increase take-home cash. Instead:

- Your **pay packet shrinks** (because you're diverting income into super)
- **Net-to-super increases** after contributions tax
- Over time, compounding inside super amplifies benefits

**When it makes sense**

- You're in a higher tax bracket  
- You can comfortably reduce take-home pay  
- You're saving for long-term retirement goals  

**When to be cautious**

- Cash-flow tight
- You’re close to retirement and might trigger **Division 293 tax**
- You risk exceeding the concessional cap

## Work-related deductions & work-from-home

### What you can claim

To claim a deduction, an expense must:

- Be **directly related to earning income**
- Be paid by you (not reimbursed)
- Be properly **apportioned** if partly private use

Common deductions include:

- Professional memberships & union fees  
- Tools & equipment (depreciated if >$300)  
- Work-related training relevant to your role  
- Protective clothing  
- **Income protection insurance** (if outside super)

### Work-from-home (WfH) deduction

ATO’s fixed rate applies per hour worked from home. Keep:

- Records of **hours worked**
- Supporting receipts if also claiming specific items

Use a logbook, timesheet, or digital work records.

> Claiming WfH doesn't put cash in your pocket immediately — it **reduces taxable income**, lowering your final tax bill.

## Investment deductions, franking credits & negative gearing

### Investment deductions

If you invest, you may deduct:

- Loan interest for investment purposes  
- Management fees & platform fees  
- Accounting costs related to investment income  
- Brokerage fees (capital cost base treatment may apply)  
- Research subscriptions  

### Franking credits

Franked dividends come with tax credits for company tax already paid. Credits can:

- Reduce the tax you owe  
- Be refunded if credits exceed your tax liability (subject to current rules)

Great for **low-to-middle income investors and retirees**.

### Negative gearing

If expenses & interest exceed investment income, the loss can reduce taxable income.

Good to know:

- Helps reduce tax **but increases cash-flow risk**
- Should be a byproduct of a sound investment strategy  
- Rate rises can test affordability

## Offsets & levies

### LITO (Low Income Tax Offset)
Available for incomes generally up to **$66,667**, reducing tax for lower-income earners.

### SAPTO (Seniors & Pensioners Tax Offset)
Significant relief for eligible retirees based on thresholds and tapering rules.

### Medicare Levy & MLS
- Medicare levy: generally **2%** of taxable income
- Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS): 1%–1.5% if income exceeds thresholds **and** no private hospital cover

Private hospital cover may cost less than the MLS for higher earners.

---

## Small business & side-hustle strategies

Common legal strategies include:

- Immediate deductions for eligible assets (thresholds vary by year)  
- Deductible business-related home expenses (different from employee WfH rules)  
- Prepaying up to **12 months** of deductible expenses  
- Super contributions as a business expense (within caps)  

> Strategy first, tax second: the goal is profitable business activity, not just deductions.

---

## Structuring & timing strategies

- **Bring forward deductions** if this year’s income is higher  
- **Defer income** where appropriate  
- Hold assets **>12 months** for the CGT 50% discount  
- Consider whether holding assets in **super**, **personal names**, or a **company/trust** is appropriate (seek advice)

## Mini case studies

### Case study 1 — Salary sacrifice + WfH

Amira earns **$110,000**. She salary-sacrifices **$12,000** and works **520 hours from home**.

**Impact:**
- **Taxable income falls** by ~$12,350 (sacrifice + WfH deduction)
- She pays **contributions tax** in super on the $12,000
- **Take-home cash decreases**, but she builds **more super wealth after tax**
- Over time, compounding inside super enhances the benefit

This is a long-term wealth-building strategy, not a short-term cash boost.

### Case study 2 — Franking credits

Josh receives franked dividends. His franking credits:

- Increase assessable income
- Then reduce tax dollar-for-dollar
- Can result in a refund if credits exceed tax owed

### Case study 3 — Negative gearing discipline

Lani’s investment property is negatively geared:

- Her rental loss reduces taxable income
- But rising interest rates mean she monitors cashflow
- The tax benefit is **secondary** to investment quality
