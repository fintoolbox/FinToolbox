              FinToolbox aims to help Australians make sense of personal
              finance by offering simple calculators and guides. The results
              from these tools are estimates only and may not reflect your
              exact circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>
              The data, thresholds, and rates used in calculators (such as tax,
              pension, or superannuation rules) are sourced from Australian
              Government and ATO publications, but may change without notice.
              While care is taken to ensure accuracy, FinToolbox{" "}

            <p>
              You should not rely solely on these calculators or articles when
              making financial decisions. Always consider your personal
              objectives, financial situation, and needs before acting on any
              information. For personal advice, consult a licensed financial
              adviser or tax professional.
